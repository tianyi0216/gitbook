### CS 400 - Programming III

**Instructor:** Gary Dahl

**Requirements:** Required for CS

**Workload:** There were weekly activities, 3 exams, and 3 projects to be completed in a team of 4. I spent about 5 hours per week.&#x20;

**Comment:** This is the last course in the sequence of 200-300-400. The class still uses Java and IMO it is easier than 300. We covered more data structures and algorithms such as hashtable, red black tree, and graphs. There was a lot of content and we did not cover much in depth of those, so it is really hard to prepare for exams.&#x20;

Gary was a good lecturer and he explained the content well. Though I also heard that now he wasn't as good as when I took it. But I would still recommend taking with Gary as 400 isn't a super difficult class that you absolutely need a super good instructor for it to make sense.&#x20;

I highly recommend finding a good teammate since teamwork is a large component of this class. A bad team does not affect your grade as much, but it makes you unhappy for sure.

**Difficulty:** 3.5/5

**Recommend:** 4/5

### CS 354 - Machine Organization and Programming

**Instructor:** Michael Doescher

**Requirements:** Required for CS

**Workload:** There were weekly activities, quizzes, and 6 projects to be completed. 2 exams. I spent about 8-10 hours per week.

**Comment:** This was the hardest class I took in my freshmen year. 354 used C and I had only a little C++ knowledge before so it took a lot of time for me to get used to it. Content covered includes C programming, DMA, assembly, caching, and basic operating system concepts. This was a difficult class and exam averages were about 55-60%. It lays foundation for classes such as 537 and 564.

We had prof Michael Doescher. He got some criticism for giving too much work and always fall behind schedule. In our semester, we were also behind schedule but he did not give a lot of work so it was all good. I think he is a lot nicer than some Reddit posts said.&#x20;

**Difficulty:** 4.5/5

**Recommend:** 3/5



### CS 220 - Data Science Programming I

**Instructor:** Meenakshi Syamkumar

**Requirements:** Satisfy DS requirement (or CS 300)

**Workload:** There were weekly quizzes, 13 projects, required lab attendance, and 3 exams. I spent about 2-4 hrs per week.

**Comment:** This was a very easy intro data science class and IMO the easiest class offered by the CS department. If you do work you would definitely get an A. This is a great intro to CS class for those who have no programming experience before. Content covered basic programming concepts in Python, CSV/JSON data, Pandas, Plotting, and Web.&#x20;

I would recommend taking CS 320 if you have already got the 300 credits, or CS 368 if you want to learn Python. I only took this class because I already have CS 354, 400, and MATH 340 but regretting taking this class because it is just too easy if you have already taken CS 300. But it was chill.

**Difficulty:** 1.5/5

**Recommend:** 3.5/5



### MATH 340 - Elementary Matrix and Linear Algebra

**Instructor:** Aleksandra Sobieska-Snyder

**Requirements:** Additional Math requirement for CS, Linear Algebra for Math, DS

**Workload:** There were weekly HW and 4 exams. I spent about 5hrs per week.

**Comment:** This was a very easy intro data science class and IMO the easiest class offered by the CS department. If you do work you would definitely get an A. This is a great intro to CS class for those who have no programming experience before. Content covered basic programming concepts in Python, CSV/JSON data, Pandas, Plotting, and Web.&#x20;
