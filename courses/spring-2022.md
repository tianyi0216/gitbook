### CS 400 - Programming III

**Instructor:** Gary Dahl

**Requirements:** Required for CS

**Workload:** There were weekly activities, 3 exams, and 3 projects to be completed in a team of 4. I spent about 5 hours per week.&#x20;

**Comment:** This is the last course in the sequence of 200-300-400. The class still uses Java and IMO it is easier than 300. We covered more data structures and algorithms such as hashtable, red black tree, and graphs. There was a lot of content and we did not cover much in depth of those, so it is really hard to prepare for exams.&#x20;

Gary was a good lecturer and he explained the content well. Though I also heard that now he wasn't as good as when I took it. But I would still recommend taking with Gary as 400 isn't a super difficult class that you absolutely need a super good instructor for it to make sense.&#x20;

I highly recommend finding a good teammate since teamwork is a large component of this class. A bad team does not affect your grade as much, but it makes you unhappy for sure.

**Difficulty:** 3.5/5

**Recommend:** 4/5
