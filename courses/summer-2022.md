# Summer 2022

### CS 240 - Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

**Instructor:** Jacob Fiedler

**Requirements:** Required for CS

**Workload:** There were weekly Zybook assignments, discussions (mandatory, attendance taken), HW, and 3 exams. I spent about 6-7 hrs per week for this class. (Summer)

**Comment:** Looking back on this class, the contents were not difficult at all, but I did feel very tired when I took this class (maybe because it was in summer and I did not go to a single discussion which was 3% of the grade). We covered basic mathematical argument, proof, set, recursion, induction, probability, graph, etc. The class is extremely useful for 577 or 520 and theoretical comp sci. In summer, we had Jake, which was a Math PhD student, and tbh I think he taught it pretty hard, and all exams, hws were hard (felt like a 500 level math). But there was a big curve and you do learn a lot.&#x20;

**Difficulty:** 3.5/5

**Recommend:** 3/5



### ASIALANG 203 - Third Semester Japanese

**Instructor:** Yuki Sakomura - instructor, Mitsuhiro Kono - TA

**Requirements:** None, but if you are majoring/minoring in Japanese then you need this class

**Workload:** Attendance is mandatory (4hrs per day M-F lol), there were lots of weekly assignments. There were also a few quizzes, and exams. I spent about 6 hrs per week.

**Comment:** This was an intensive Japanese class in the summer (you finish 3rd- 4th in 8 weeks). It was really hard getting up early every day and having class until 1pm every single day. But the takeaway was huge. I felt my Japanese got a lot better. Workload can be huge but it is mostly busy work and nothing super difficult. Sakomura sensei is really nice and ends up curving a lot (I think everyone got at least AB lol). We covered more advanced grammar, Keigo, passive form, etc. This was definitely a step up from 2nd semester.

**Difficulty:** 2/5

**Recommend:** 4/5



### ASIALANG 204 - Forth Semester Japanese

**Instructor:** Yuki Shimizu- instructor, Taiga Ikedo - TA

**Requirements:** None, but if you are majoring/minoring in Japanese then you need this class

**Workload:** Attendance is mandatory (4hrs per day M-F lol), there were lots of weekly assignments. There were also a few quizzes, and exams. I spent about 6 hrs per week.

**Comment:** Continuation from 3rd semester. We cover a lot more advance grammar, and writing and the class is def harder than 3rd semester and requires a lot more advanced reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills. We started reading long articles and also writing longer, formal essays. Shimizu sensei is a lot more strict IMO and she did not curve much, but I still end up with a high grade. The class was still pretty chill.

**Difficulty:** 2/5

**Recommend:** 4/5
