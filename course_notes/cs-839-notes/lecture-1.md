Modern: data-driven graphics. Graphics -> Image Retrieval.

Composting multiple parts: User input + database images -> output.

But we want to be "realisitic".



| Computer Graphics                                  | Photography                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Great creative possibilities                       | Instantly realistic                   |
| Easy to manipulate objects/viewpoint               | Easy to aqure                         |
| Tremendous expertise and effort to obtain realism. | Hard to manipulate objects/viewpoint. |

Want realism, manipulation, and ease of capture.



Success today: big compute (GPUs), big models (DNN) and Big data.
