Photography

Goal: Help everyone create visual context easily.

Teach machines to create realistic content.



today: pretty real. data-driven graphics.



Ingredients for success today:

1. big compute (gpus)
2. big models (dnns)
3. big data



Highlights:

image to image translation - pix2pix.  (GANs) input can be translated into other view.

Style transfer -> image + styleize it by taking a reference image.

View interprolation ( change view)

Text-based image editing.
