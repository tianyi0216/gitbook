# Network Visualization

There are 2 categories: Node-link diagram and adjacency matrix. Tree can be containment channel.

Node-link diagram: node as points and there exists link between them. Networks are commly represented as such, using connection. Nodes closed have tight grouping. (distance corresponding to link).&#x20;

Network topology: direct and indirect connections between nodes in terms of the number of hops between them through the set of links.

Force-directed placement - many variants in the force-directed placement idiom family. Place nodes in random spatial regions and iteratively modify their location according to "push and pulling" forces. - non-deterministic.

Matrix views: adjacency matrix view. Can also show weighted networks, each edge has weight. (Size, ordered channel etc.)
