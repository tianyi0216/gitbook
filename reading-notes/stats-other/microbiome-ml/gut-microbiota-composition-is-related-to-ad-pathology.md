# Gut Microbiota Composition is related to AD Pathology

Summary:

Author tries to investigate the associations between gut microbiota composition and AD biomarkers using ML models in patients with AD, MCI and SCD.&#x20;

Methods:

Statistical Inference and Machine Learning. Machine Learning Model used: XGBoost (Extreme gradient boosting trees). Then, use logistic regression to obtain effect sizes of associations (between highest ranked microbes and outcome of 3 ML models (predictors)).

Statistical Analysis: ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square. PERMANOVA.

Conclusion: Were able to find associations, lower abundance of SCFA-producing microbes was associated with higher odds of AD pathology.
