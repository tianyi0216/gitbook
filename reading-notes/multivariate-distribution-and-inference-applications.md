# Multivariate Distribution and Inference Applications

Summary: The paper introduce a multivariate family of distributions for multivariate count data with excess zeros,which is a multivariate extension of univariate zero-inflated bell distribution. Model parameters are estimated using traditional maximum likelihood estimation. They also develop a EM algorithm to compute the MLE of parameters with closed-form expressions.&#x20;

Univariate bell family's Probability Mass Function:

$$
f_{Bell}(x; \alpha) := Pr(X = x) = \exp(1-e^{W(\alpha)})\frac{W(\alpha)^{x}B_x}{x!}, x = 0,1,\dots
$$

where $$\alpha > 0$$, $$W(.)$$ denote the principal branch of Lambert function, $$B_x$$ are the bell numbers.&#x20;
