# How to Visualize Large Network

This is a great question and I do not know the answer. In general, I found visualizing a large, dense network with lots of nodes and edges very difficult.

This article here [https://mr.schochastics.net/material/netVizR/](https://mr.schochastics.net/material/netVizR/)  contains some code and ways of using the `ggraph` package in R to solve this issue and I found it pretty helpful.
